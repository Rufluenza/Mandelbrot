# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot set made in python using matplotlib to display the set.
It has a zoom effect and you can change how big of a "resolution" the mandelbrot has depending on the max iterations.
I am working on getting the save feature to work properly but currently it only saves a blank 3 second long mp4 file.
