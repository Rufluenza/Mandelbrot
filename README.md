# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot set made in python using matplotlib to display the set.
I am currently working on the zoom in effect and to save it properly.
If you wish to only display the set without the zoom just type 'n' in the start prompt

you will need to have FFMpeg downloaded and put in the Documents folder otherwise it cannot save the file
